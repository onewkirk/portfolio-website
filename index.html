							<h2>Where I Attend Class</h2>
							<p>I am studying Full-Stack Web Devolpment online with Lambda School. Lambda School is an audacious instituion that has created a non-traditional coding "bootcamp". Where most educational institutions' business model is centered around selling degrees, Lambda School prides itself in coaching students in practical skills, then being reimbursed through a share of the salaries of students who go through the program. </p>

							<h2>A Look at My Personal Life</h2>
							<p>My family and I live in Albuquerque, NM. It's a beautiful place, and we have access to some really great local wine and beer. The food scene is pretty amazing as well. The biggest perk, is proximity to my wife's family, who have been gracious enough to help with childcare while I make something of myself. Below, you can get a look at some of my interests, and some things I do when I'm not coding.</p>

							<h2>More Fun Ideas</h2>
							<p>I'm going to free associate with the icons above these sections, because I think they're cool, and it may be useful to reference them later.</p>
							<div class="items style1 medium onscroll-fade-in">
								<section>
									<span class="icon style2 major fa-gem"></span>
									<h3>Gem</h3>
									<p>This makes me think  of something from a pirate novel. Or a video game. This makes me think of excellent ideas/achievements and money. </p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid style2 major fa-save"></span>
									<h3>Save</h3>
									<p>I grew up using the 3.5" floppy, that was notably less "floppy" than their 8" and 5.25" forebears. I'll never be able to see this icon as anything other than "save".</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid style2 major fa-chart-bar"></span>
									<h3>Chart Bar</h3>
									<p>I like spreadsheets and data, so I'll be shocked if I don't find some way to shoehorn this one into some project in the future.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid style2 major fa-wifi"></span>
									<h3>Wifi</h3>
									<p>Just imagining these lines not stacked to the top, and my enraged wife tossing her $1,200 phone across the hotel room. OtterBox makes some quality cases.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid style2 major fa-cog"></span>
									<h3>Cog</h3>
									<p>On a good day, this makes me feel like I'm going to get some useful information about how something works. On a bad day, I start imagining myself at Kafka School for Web Development, where my code won't render, unless I attach a "liar" tag to every element before receiving a message that I don't matter, and to just go take my place in the queue. Today is a good day.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon style2 major fa-paper-plane"></span>
									<h3>Paper Plane</h3>
									<p>Probably some trauma rewriting, but I feel like I remember Clippy in the old MS Word pulling up in one of these.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid style2 major fa-desktop"></span>
									<h3>Desktop</h3>
									<p>I really hope my monitor has the specs to handle whatever this section is going to throw at it. When I grow up, maybe I'll get a second monitor for some split-screen magic. Tonight, I'm eating leftover cup ramen, so that's a dream for anther time.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid style2 major fa-sync-alt"></span>
									<h3>Sync</h3>
									<p>I'm getting a refreshing feeling. This makes me feel accomplished, as though something in the world is linking up the way it is supposed to, and I get credit for it. Thank you.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid style2 major fa-hashtag"></span>
									<h3>#Hashtag</h3>
									<p>My first phone did not have one of these, and it was like magic when we got a phone that did. Now, I just hope to learn why this is a part of Twitterspeak before I am expected to know.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid style2 major fa-bolt"></span>
									<h3>Bolt</h3>
									<p>Power is good. Still, I feel like this bodes ill, if I see this icon on a computer. I'll give it the benefit of the doubt and say this section's about The Flash.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid style2 major fa-envelope"></span>
									<h3>Envelope</h3>
									<p>Both my parents worked in a post office, and this still means "email". In my case, mostly spam mail for medication that I am confident I'd need a doctor to prescribe to access legally.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid style2 major fa-leaf"></span>
									<h3>Leaf</h3>
									<p>We are green. Our services are worth more, because our imputs are more expensive. Also, we're not trashing our neighbors' backyard. Because that's a way we have to bribe folks to be. "#2020"</p>
